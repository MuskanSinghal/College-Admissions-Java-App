# College-Admissions-Java-App
A Java app for aiding the college admissions process

Hi!!

This is a Java application built by me as a part of my Data Structures course. This app has the capability to aid the admissions process wherein a student can block his/her seat and this information accordingly updates in a central file. The Administrator can login using the username and password as admin and admin and then accordingly set the number of seats available. He/She will have a seperate page
